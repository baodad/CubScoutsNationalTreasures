# CubScoutsNationalTreasures
A few extra resources for "Our National Treasures" pack meeting plan developed by the Boy Scouts of America.  The original pack meeting plans are currently available at: https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/cubscouts/pdf/YEAR2/310-842(15)_March%20Loyal_WEB.pdf

Main page for other BSA-produced pack meetings plans is currently at: https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/pack-meeting-resources/pack-meeting-plans/

The main file in this repository is a Macro-enabled Powerpoint file that is essentially a memory game.  When you click on the cards, they move out of the way for a moment and reveal the picture underneath.  When a picture is guessed correctly, click on the number boxes (1, 2, 3... etc.) to permanently reveal the picture (click the number again to re-hide).

The way we used this game was to divide our pack into teams, and take turns asking them questions from the National Treasures Questions.xlsx file in this repository.  After each question, the team or a specific individual on the team then chose a number corresponding to those cards in the Powerpoint presentation displayed for all to see.  If they chose correctly, the picture in the game was permanently revealed.  Plays continues until all picture cards in the Powerpoint presentation are revealed.

To help those in attendance become more familiar with the eight "national treasures" featured in this pack meeting plan, we printed out cards with the pictures on the front, and the facts on the back, as taken from the National Treasures Facts.docx file in this repo.  Cards were provided at the beginning of the pack meeting (as a gathering activity) for all to study.

Also, before the game, we showed this YouTube video, which does a Google Earth flyover of the Washington Monumnent, the Statue of Liberty, the 9/11 Memorial, Mount Rushmore, the USS Arizona WWII Memorial in Pearl Harbor, and the Grand Canyon: https://youtu.be/nv8Tp9EYKts
